Planet Name;Planet Type;Planet Description
Sun;Star (Yellow Dwarf);The sun is the star in the center of our solar system. It is a yellow dwarf, which tells us information about the size and temperature of the star. The Sun is fueled by hydrogen, which is fused into helium, freeing energy in the process. 
Mercury;Rocky Planet;Mercury is the closest planet to the sun in our solar system. It is named after the Roman god of commerce and communication. An interesting fact about mercury is that a planet rotation will last longer than a complete trip around the sun, making days longer than years!
Venus;Rocky Planet;"Venus is the first planet inside the ""habitable zone"" of our solar system. It has very similar characteristics to Earth and is therefore a possible candidate for the terraforming process. It is named after the Roman goddess of beauty and love."
Earth;Rocky Planet;Earth, Terra, or even Gaia, are the names referring to our home world. This little blue gem is the third planet from the sun, lays in the habitable zone and is (for now) the only known planet to harbor life.
Earths Moon;Rocky Moon;The moon is earth's only natural satellite. The light reflected from the sun depicts this beautiful sphere into the night-, and day- sky with different shapes and sizes. Although the exact creation of the moon is still unclear, the most accepted theory tells us that a planet about the size of mars crashed into our planet. The material ejection from the core that followed the impact pushed huge quantities of molten rocks into space, creating our beautiful moon.
Mars;Rocky Planet;Mars is the last planet in the habitable zone of our solar system, at least for carbon-based life forms living on the surface. It is named after the Roman god of war and appears as a red ball with two ice poles, mostly due to the desert-like surface. Although most see Mars as the next human colony, a thin atmosphere makes the planet's inhabitants vulnerable to solar storms.
Phobos;Rocky Moon;The largest moon of Mars, Phobos is named after the Greek god of fear. Due to the fact that the non-spherical moon is slowly falling towards the surface of mars, scientists were led to believe that phobos was hollow on the inside, leading to many speculations about the nature of the object, some even theorizing alien involvement. These theories were later disproved, the reason being faulty measurements in the first place.
Deimos;Rocky Moon;Deimos is the second moon of mars, named after the Greek god of dread and terror. Like his brother it's a non-spherical moon, although Deimos is much smoother compared to Phobos, mostly because of the presence of smooth regolite. The moon is so small, that the escape velocity is lower than the acceleration of a human jumping! - NASA suggests strapping yourself to the ground when visiting Deimos. Failure to do so might result into eternal damnation into the void of space. -
Jupiter;Gas Giant;Jupiter is the first planet of our solar system after the asteroid belt and also the largest one. Named after the Roman chief god, this gas giant has more mass than all the other planets in the solar system combined. The atmosphere of Jupiter is often subject to storms, the most famous one being the Great Red Spot, a storm that has been seen for the first time in 1831 and is still ongoing! 
Saturn;Gas Giant;"Named after the Roman god of time, Saturn is one of the most recognizable planets of our entire system, due to its beautiful rings. This gas giant might not be as big as Jupiter, but it has lots of things in common. Both are mostly made out of a mix of hydrogen and helium, and both have rings and a large number of moons. Saturn also features a tribute to George Lucas, the creator of the Star Wars Saga, by owning the moon ""Mimas"", which shape was clearly inspired by the Death Star."
Uranus;Ice Giant;Uranus is the seventh planet from the sun. Its name derives from the Greek god of the sky and the planet is the closest ice giant to the sun. It has rings, moons and an atmosphere, but it's also the place with the lowest minimum temperature in the entire solar system! 
Neptune;Ice Giant;Neptune is the last (known) planet in our solar system. Named after the Roman god of the sea, it's also an ice giant, due to the high presence of frozen molecules in its atmosphere. It's not visible to the naked eye, and is therefore the first planet to be found first using mathematical calculation, and only after that a telescopic observation. 
Pluto;Dwarf Planet;"Pluto was the last (known) planet in our solar system, until it wasn't. The international astronomical union officially demoted the body to a dwarf planet in 2006, mostly because he lacked to ""gravitationally dominate"" its neighbourhood. Pluto is named after the Roman god of the underworld, and the planet is now part of the Kupier Belt, the second asteroid belt of our solar system."
